Task Description:
The task involves predicting area safety using machine learning based on various attributes present in the dataset. The primary goal is to analyze the given data, preprocess it, split it into training and testing sets, train a decision tree model, and evaluate its performance.

Steps in the Task:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and normalizing numerical attributes.

Splitting the Data: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets to build and evaluate the model.

Model Training: Implementing a Decision Tree classifier to learn patterns from the training data.

Model Evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report to measure performance.

Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional): Optimizing the model parameters to improve accuracy.

Predictions: Using the trained model to classify new data points into safe or unsafe areas.


The ultimate objective is to build an accurate predictive model that can assist in determining the safety of different locations based on relevant features.
